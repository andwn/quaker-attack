## Quaker Attack
Another old thing. This was created in a proprietary language called "Monkey" which is compiled into javascript. Not sure if I have the source lying around, but it isn't impossible to read the JS or anything.

The first version of this game was created in Game Maker in 2006. The HTML5 version was rewritten in 2011 if the note on the title screen is to be trusted.

You can play the game [here](https://pumpkinhill.zone/quaker/index.html), high scores are disabled. I am not running any of the PHP. The config.php file has a username and password to a MySQL database which no longer exists.
